                                Tayras is my go to guy when it comes to getting any 2d graphics done. He does quick, quality work.
                                When he made my studio logo he nailed it on the first try,
                                I didn't even have to ask him to change anything. Personally I think he's the best at what he does.

                                The go to bot developer for me. Tayras communicates well with his
                                team and make sure to get stuff done. I've worked with him for a
                                while now and he is someone I can rely on when It comes to bot development.
